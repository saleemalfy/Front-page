                    <h3>About us:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since 2007, we started working at the Auto parts departments at car dealerships, and at the parts counter at Auto parts stores. We found that many customers, unfortunately decide to scrap their cars, as sometimes it’s cost-prohibitive for them to fix them, due to the high cost of brand-new parts and the high cost of labour charged by mechanics. If you even have a little mechanical inclination, there many resources for you to do many car-repair jobs yourself! And be proud of your vehicle. Or if the job is too complicated for you, you can refer it to a mechanic, and it would still be worth your while. Used parts average between 25-60% of an equivalent aftermarket new part, and about 10-20% of equivalent parts at the dealerships! To give you an examples, a starter at the dealership for a first and second generation Ford focus costs 560$++. An after market is about 50% less. Equivalent starter with the shipping fees, would cost you no more than 82$. Bear in mind that some parts can only be purchased at car dealerships, where they charge an arm and a leg! A very high percentage of the car parts can be recycled and reused again, as they are not wear and tear item. I.e, valve covers, steering knuckles, some suspension components, steering columns, most of the body parts, cargo covers for station wagons, …etc. Pretty much all cars have car-repair manuals that adequately explain how to do many repair jobs, and with the availability of the internet.</p>
                    <p>As we are mechanically-certified, All components are tested rigorously before shipping. we started dealing in engine parts in , with 9 years of experience .

                    <h3>Returns</h3>
                    <p> Due to the fact that all returns have to reach us 1 If you receive your item and you wish to return it, please do so within the first 2 days of receiving the item, as we will not accept returns after two days from receiving the item. All items are marked before shipping, so the exact marking has to match or records. All returned items have to be returned in original condition, without any signs of abuse or defects from improper installation or handling. Items would have to be shipped back at the expense of the buyer. Once the item has been received in its original condition we will issue the buyer a refund for the price of the item (**) minus 20% restocking fees. (**) your refund will not include the shipping fees, for obvious reasons. Example: you bought an alternator for 60$ and the shipping fees were 25$. Grand total will be 85$. If you wish to return the item, you would have to pay for the shipping fees yourself to have it shipped back to us. Once we receive the alternator, we reimburse you 60*.80=48$.</p>

                    <h3>Why is it a Good idea to order through Us?</h3>
                    <p>Give your car a new lease of life, and buy the right part for it for the right price. Used car parts are very much wallet-friendly, and not as cost prohibitive as new parts, even after adding the shipping/freight fees. Buy with confidence, as we do not sell wear and tear items, which are only to be purchased new to serve their purpose. Like for instance, spark plugs, v-belts, bushings, brake pads and shoes…etc. We do not sell safety items like airbags, or airbag components either. It’s a budget-oriented way of prolonging the life of your vehicle and it’s also a green way of recycling vehicle parts, hence the name: Affordable Green Parts!

                    <p> <strong>Added note:</strong> please try to be as descriptive as you can when placing an order. Please specify car make, model, year of manufacture and most importantly the VIN (vehicle identification number for it). Only if applicable, please also specify trim and color. If it was a piece of interior trim, don’t forget to mention color name, shade. Sometimes in some special cases a picture will be very helpful. Like Confucius said, “a picture is worth a thousand words”. </p>

            <p> The fine print: Please make sure that your address with paypal is confirmed. It is your responsibility to update your shipping address, not ours. If you need the part to be shipped to a third party, please notify us of that, by sending us a note with your paypal payment information. Please note that all parcels will be marked “Abandon in case of non-delivery”, otherwise the item will be re-shipped back to us, in case you have moved from the address given to us, at our expense.
