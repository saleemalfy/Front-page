            <h3><a name="Q1">How it Works:</a></h3>
            <p>It’s very simple. Just follow these easy steps. 1-First, set up an account with Paypal. Your payment is handled by a third party so you don’t have to worry about your credit card being compromised.2-Go to the contact us page, and fill out the form. In the short message, please describe the part that you’re looking for. Don’t forget to write your updated address, as we will need this to get back to you with an approximate shipping fees.3-We search our inventory and get back to you in less than 3 business days, if we have the part, with an approximate total (item+shipping), as we do not package items for shipping unless they have been paid for.4-Through paypal, you give us authorisation of payment for the part and shipping fees. Your funds are then held by paypal for 3 days. 5-We get the part packaged and then ship it to address you have provided. From the Autherization, we deduct price of item and shipping and handling fees. The balance of your autherisation, should there be any,gets credited back to you by paypal.
                <br><strong>Example:</strong> you requested a steering knuckle for your car. You specified the model, year, VIN L,or R,together with your mailing address. We’re listing steering knuckles for 85$.We estimated the shipping and handling fees to your address to be 45$. So we send you the preauthorization request through paypal to pay 130$. Once we get that, we ship your item. Assuming it cost only39$ S+H to your address, then we capture only 85+39=124$. So you get 6$ credited back to your paypal account.</p>

            <h3>Why is it a Good idea to order through Us?</h3>
            <p>Give your car a new lease of life, and buy the right part for it for the right price.At AGP,our parts are very much budget-oriented, and on average they would cost you 10-20% of the price of the same part at the dealership.

            <p>With Affordable Green parts, BUY with Confidence. An easy and Very Affordable way to extend the life of your vehicle</p>
            <p><strong>By buying your part, you are agreeing to the aforementioned terms and conditions. </strong>

                <h3>About us:</h3>
                <p>
                    Our team is made of people who have worked at Auto parts departments at car dealerships, and at Auto parts stores. From our experience we found that many customers, unfortunately, decide to scrap their vehicles, as sometimes it’s cost-prohibitive for them to fix them, due to the high cost of brand-new, and aftermarket parts as well as the high cost of labour charged by mechanics. This is our solution to this problem: <strong><i>Providing the customers with tested Used car parts at competitive prices.</strong></i>
                    If you have the mechanical inclination, there are many resources for you to refer to, to do many car repair jobs yourself! Or if the job is too complicated or dangerous, you can buy the parts through us and have them installed by your mechanic and it would still be worth your while for you even after paying for the shipping fees. Used parts average between 25-60% of an equivalent aftermarket new part, and about 10-20% of equivalent new OEM parts at the dealerships! To give you an examples, a starter at the dealership for a vehicle X, would cost about 560$++. An after market is about 60% less. From AGP, equivalent starter inclusive of the shipping fees, would cost you no more than 85$. Bear in mind that some parts can only be purchased at car dealerships, as there is no aftermarket equivalent. A very high percentage of used car parts can be recycled and reused again, as they are not wear and tear part. I.e, valve covers, steering knuckles, some suspension components, steering columns, most of the body parts, cargo covers for station wagons, …etc. Pretty much all cars have car-repair manuals that adequately explain how to do many repair jobs, and with the availability of the internet.</p>
